## What is left to do:

- Password reinitialization
- Change username (everywhere in db)
- Change email (also everywhere, but it's used less often)
- Improve backend validation by adding regex checking to each and every input

- Add breakpoints to the UI to make it mobile friendly

- Add upload of images to be edited
- Make the snap button inactive if there aren't any superposables in the image area

- Improve infra, set front baseUrl dynamically
- Set php ini with nginx for mail configuration
- Fix Nginx size limitations
- Email configuration might be hard
